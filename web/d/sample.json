At a time when 35 million Americans lack health insurance, Planned Parenthood clinics all over the country provide health care to over 2 million women each year, including 1.5 million low-income patients. Instead of trying to take away health care from millions of women, we should be passing legislation to provide family and medical leave to all of our families."},
